## Decisions Made This Session

- Added Button and Input to shared ui/ components (not in original CLAUDE.md)
- Deferred SectionHeader, ErrorMessage, MacroCard, CalorieRing — no immediate use case
- CalorieRing deferred to step 16 (dashboard)
- MacroCard deferred to step 11 (food log) where need will be clearer
- Macro education tooltips added to backlog (implement after step 16)

- App.jsx uses a div wrapper instead of fragment to set bg-bg-page as global background
- SessionExpiredModal tested and working

- Changed --color-green from #22c55e to #10b981 (less neon, more refined)
- Removed @import "tailwindcss" from index.css — @tailwindcss/vite plugin handles it automatically
- Added path alias @ → src/ in vite.config.js

- Added noValidate to all auth forms — browser native validation disabled
- Fixed apiClient 401 handling — auth endpoints don't trigger SessionExpiredModal
- Moved json parsing before 401 check in apiClient

- Gender options: Male and Female only (DESIGN.md is correct). Mockup showing "Other" was a reference artefact, not a spec. Onboarding.jsx updated accordingly.
- Output discipline rule added to CLAUDE.md — one file at a time, stop and wait for confirmation
- RestTemplate declared as a @Bean in RestTemplateConfig — Spring Boot does not auto-configure it
- Anthropic API key must be set as environment variable ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and referenced in application.properties as anthropic.api-key=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}

- Demo users go through onboarding (hasCompletedOnboarding = false) — AI suggestion
  is a key feature worth showcasing
- Demo banner added to onboarding — informs user what the flow is for
- AuthContext deferred from step 7 — being built now as part of step 8
- Auth routing strategy: App load calls GET /api/users/me to check auth state.
  401 = not authenticated. 200 = authenticated, route based on hasCompletedOnboarding
- Login redirects to /onboarding if hasCompletedOnboarding = false, /dashboard if true
- Skip onboarding sets hasCompletedOnboarding = true on backend — never re-asked on next login
- Gender.OTHER left in User enum — frontend only exposes Male/Female, no migration needed now

- apiClient returns json.data directly (envelope already unwrapped).
  Never do data.data in components — use data directly.
- Anthropic model string is claude-opus-4-5 (not claude-opus-4-20250514)
- AI suggestion failure falls through to manual entry (AdjustForm) instead of dead-end error
- Placeholder /dashboard route added to App.jsx — will be replaced in step 16
- completeOnboarding() called in AuthContext after save and skip to keep in-memory user state in sync

- Redis is used as a fetch-guard only (presence of key = query already fetched from OpenFoodFacts). Results are always read from PostgreSQL. Not a product cache — PostgreSQL is the result store.
- Minimum query length of 2 characters enforced in FoodController before hitting the service.
- FoodDtos.FoodItemResponse includes isFavourite to avoid a second request from the frontend.
- Result ordering in FoodService: favourites first, then alphabetical. Previously-logged ordering deferred to step 11 when FoodLog queries are available.
- Redis is a fetch-guard only — presence of key means query already fetched from OpenFoodFacts. Results always read from PostgreSQL. Not a product cache.
- Only cache if OpenFoodFacts returns results. Empty results do not set the cache key — prevents poisoning the cache on 503s.
- User-Agent header required by OpenFoodFacts — anonymous requests get rate limited with 503. Configured via app.openfoodfacts.user-agent in application.yml.
- created_by is null for OpenFoodFacts items by design — only set for USER_CREATED foods.
- FoodItemCard.jsx frontend test deferred to step 11 — testing in isolation with hardcoded props doesn't prove integration. Real test is when wired to live search in food log page.
- Food log page loads with empty state + search bar. No preloaded products. Results appear on user input with 300ms debounce. Recent foods (from FoodLog) shown when search is empty — implement in step 11.
- ObjectMapper and TypeReference were incorrectly included in FoodService imports — removed.
- @RequiredArgsConstructor dropped from OpenFoodFactsClient — @Value doesn't work with Lombok's generated constructors, switched to manual constructor.

- addFavourite is idempotent — If you favourite something that's already a favourite, nothing happens. No error, no duplicate — it just ignores the request.
- apiClient is a named export, not default. Always import as: import { apiClient } from '@/apiClient'

- apiClient is a named export. Always import as: import { apiClient } from '@/apiClient'. Never use default import.
  
- AppException constructor signature is (HttpStatus status, String message) — status first, message second
- FoodLogResponse includes computed macros (calories, protein, carbs, fat) scaled to amountGrams — avoids client-side calculation
- loggedAt stored as date.atStartOfDay() — client sends date only, not a full timestamp
- BigDecimal macro fields must be converted via .doubleValue() before arithmetic in FoodLogService
- UserService.getIdByEmail(String email) added as a wrapper around userRepository.findByEmail
- JwtAuthFilter sets principal as User entity, not UserDetails — always use @AuthenticationPrincipal User user in controllers, never UserDetails. Call user.getId() directly

- apiClient must handle empty responses (204 No Content) — use response.text() then JSON.parse only if non-empty, otherwise default to {}
- Never call JSON.stringify on body in components — apiClient handles serialization itself
- OpenFoodFacts rate limiting is a known issue — try to look for alternative later, cached PostgreSQL data still work

- Frontend will be fully rebuilt based on new designs created before starting step 14
- All backend is complete — do not touch backend during frontend pass unless a bug is found
- Existing frontend pages (auth, onboarding, food log) will be reviewed and updated to match new designs during the frontend pass

- AuthShell promoted to shared component — used by all 4 auth pages
- text-2xl font-bold text-green for "Caicai" brand wordmark on auth pages
- Inline style used for radial gradient (#052e16 → #0f0f0f) — no Tailwind utility covers this
- Input accepts optional labelAction prop for inline label-row elements
- PROJECT_STATUS.md summary provided at end of task, not after every file

- Onboarding layout: centered max-w-3xl card, header + progress bar outside card, justify-center on outer div
- Onboarding background: same radial gradient as AuthShell (radial-gradient(ellipse 80% 60% at 0% 0%, #052e16 0%, #0f0f0f 60%)), applied inline — no separate component yet
- Onboarding desktop fix was layout-only — no logic changes, all three step files untouched

- /profile — read-only profile page (name, member since, weight progress, nutrition goals, personal details)
- /settings — account actions only (change email, change password, delete account)
- Desktop: sidebar user card + name link to /profile. Logout is inline below name in same card.
- Mobile: MobileHeader avatar links to /profile. Logout lives inside /profile page at the bottom.
- No /profile/:userId — no social features, revisit if ever scoped
- Page title removed from Sidebar — pages own their own titles in content area
- MobileHeader: fixed h-14, pt-14 on main content to clear it
-UserAvatar component duplicated in Sidebar and MobileHeader — extract to src/components/ui/UserAvatar.jsx during polish pass

-Decision locked: Protein = purple (#a855f7), Water = blue (#3b82f6). Applied everywhere. Never use blue for protein again.

- Steps 20 and 21 merged into a single page — FoodLog.jsx
- Food Log uses "Logged | Favourites" tab pattern — no stacked sections
- Custom dark-themed inline calendar date picker — calendar icon next to date label
- Inline card expansion for logging — no modal, no drawer. Grams input + macro preview appear below the card row
- Only one card expanded at a time — expanding a second collapses the first
- Favourites live on the Food Log page as a tab, not a separate route
- Dashboard calendar heatmap: green = calories within 10% of goal, macro dots as secondary indicators, clicking navigates to /log?date=YYYY-MM-DD — build at step 25
- Food Log must read date from URL query param when navigating from Dashboard calendar — update at step 25
- Macro summary strip: mobile = ring centered top + 4 metrics stacked. Desktop = ring left + 4 column grid
- Water added to macro summary strip — reads from dashboard daily response, no extra API call
- Nutrient color mapping locked permanently: Calories = green, Protein = purple, Carbs = orange, Fat = yellow, Water = -blue. Never deviate.
- -color-water and --color-water-bg removed from theme — water uses bg-blue/text-blue
- -color-bg-page changed from #0f0f0f to #161616 — better separation between page background and cards (#1a1a1

- Dashboard daily summary endpoint is /api/dashboard/summary not /api/dashboard/daily — use this everywhere
- Vite proxy must be configured — /api → http://localhost:8080. Without it all API calls bypass the proxy
- DatePicker is a shared component at src/components/ui/DatePicker.jsx — uses parseISO from date-fns, smart up/down positioning
- Food Log split into 4 files: FoodLog.jsx (page), ExpandableFoodCard.jsx, LoggedEntry.jsx, DatePicker.jsx
- ExpandableFoodCard has meal selector + date text input (dd/mm/yyyy) — date only affects that log entry, not the page
- CalorieRing rounds to whole numbers — backend returns doubles
- Mobile CalorieRing size: 140px. Desktop: 100px

- Steps 23, 24, 25 merged — Weight + Goals + Dashboard are one page at /dashboard
- Goals nav item removed — nav is now Dashboard | Log | Trends | Settings (4 items)
- CalorieRing shows calories consumed tracking up toward goal, label is "KCAL" not "KCAL LEFT"
- Dashboard split into 4 files: Dashboard.jsx, MacroCard.jsx, WeightSection.jsx, WeightChart.jsx
- MacroCard lives in src/pages/dashboard/ — not promoted to shared ui/
- Weight change color is goal-aware — green = toward goal, red = away from goal
- WeightService.java stores LocalDateTime.now() instead of date.atStartOfDay() — fixes same-day sort order
- Weight chart uses last 30 days, averaged per day — multiple logs per day collapse to one point
- Weight history table shows all entries, paginated at 5 per page
- ChangeLabel and build30DayChartData defined outside component to avoid hydration errors
- max-w-4xl removed from Dashboard — full width

- /profile route removed — Sidebar and MobileHeader avatar both link to /settings
- Settings has 3 tabs: Profile / Goals / Account
- /settings?tab=goals — URL param drives active tab, "Update Goals" on Dashboard navigates here
- No inline password change — Account tab sends forgot-password email instead
- Ai suggestion = coming soon placeholder for now

- EC2 security group must have explicit IPv4 rule for port 8080 — the console defaulted to IPv6 only
- Elastic IP assigned to EC2 for stable routing
- RedisConfig.java updated to use spring.data.redis.ssl.enabled property for conditional TLS
- CloudFront error pages: 403 and 404 → index.html with 200 (SPA routing fix)
- Frontend built with VITE_API_URL env var set to CloudFront domain

## Current Task

Step 31 work on backlog

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

- Food Log must read date from URL query param when navigating from Dashboard calendar — update at step 25
- FoodLogView.jsx, FoodLogTable.jsx, FoodLogCard.jsx are superseded by FoodLog.jsx — remove from repo


---

## Backlog
- AI goal re-suggestion from within the app
- AI food recommendations based on remaining daily macros
- Macro education tooltips — show a small info popup on each macro
  (protein, carbs, fat, calories) explaining what it does and why it matters.
  Extensible for when fiber, sodium, and sugar are added to the UI.
  Implement after dashboard is built (step 16).
-  Review all service methods for single point of failure — decide whether to use fault-tolerant try/catch per section (dashboard pattern) 
   or let exceptions propagate (domain endpoints). Document the decision per feature during polish pass.
- Edit email in the settings
